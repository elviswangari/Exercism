# Exercism Solutions Repository

Welcome to my **Exercism Solutions** repository! This repository contains my solutions to various exercises from [Exercism](https://exercism.org/), organized by programming language and exercise track. These exercises help improve problem-solving skills, mastery of language features, and familiarity with common coding patterns.

## 🚀 Getting Started

To run and test these exercises locally:

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/elviswangari/Exercism.git
   cd Exercism
   ```

2. **Install dependencies (if applicable):**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Run tests:**
   ```bash
   # JavaScript tests with Jest
   npm test
   # or for TypeScript
   npx tsc && npm test
   ```

## 📝 Notes on Implementation

- Code follows **idiomatic JavaScript/TypeScript** style.
- Functions are written to pass **Exercism’s automated tests** while being readable and maintainable.
- Where applicable, **JSDoc** comments are included for type hinting and clarity.
- Exercises are often implemented in multiple ways:
  - Using default parameters
  - Using arrow functions vs. standard functions
  - Minimal vs. verbose style

## 🎯 Learning Goals

This repository demonstrates:

- Problem-solving using small, focused functions.
- Understanding of JavaScript and TypeScript types and syntax.
- Familiarity with arrays, objects, and conditional logic.
- Basic functional programming concepts in JavaScript/TypeScript.
- Using `Math`, string templates, and other built-in language utilities.
